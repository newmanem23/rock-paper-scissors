# Rock Paper Scissors
This is my Rock Paper Scissors project as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

The purpose of this project is to incorporate the following:
- A simple interactive User Interface to play a game of RPS
- JavaScript code to run a game of RPS based on user input and determine a winner

You can play [here](https://newmanem23.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/) if you'd like.
